                        <p>It's exam time again, and I donâ€™t know why, but I am productive in every sense except for the
                            exam preparation. And sometimes I catch this high tide moment to embark on new ideas and
                            experiments from time to time. Being a freelancer online was one of those new ideas that hit
                            me at the end of December 2023. And up until writing this blog, it's been a month since I've
                            been continuing this. Here's my little journey in the online freelancing world, specifically
                            Upwork.
                            <--!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RWOpQXTltA"

                                Republic."
                        </p>-->



                        <p>So I have been working on audio video editing extensively for a few years now. Since last
                            year, I have been working in a professional space beyond just my personal projects.
                            Like every other creative space, I struggle with finding myself to not like the mundane and
                            am always keen on learning new ways to grow. The idea of freelancing was not new to me;
                            however, I hadn't done anything online; it was mostly just word-of-mouth freelancing among
                            the circles.
                        </p>


                        <p>TThe in-person freelancing work has its own pros and cons, with the major con being that the
                            date of payment was uncertain. I mean, I was working with people whom I could at least trust
                            a bit, but still, these uncertainties won't lead me to creating a successful business.

                        </p>

                        <h3 id="lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet">Week 1: Creation</h3>

                        <p>The first week on Upwork was like heading into the unknown, as I was just figuring out the
                            way the platform works and how to utilise its features. I had to take some time to go
                            through my dusty hard drive to find the things that would make me stand out.

                        </p>



                        <p>IAfter setting up my initial profile, the next step was to write the proposals to the clients
                            as I discovered the work that needed to be done. Now that I look back, it was easy to go for
                            every opportunity you could find to make a quick buck.
                            However, I was not making much progress on getting traction for a few interactions, leading
                            to not much work. I was also running out of Connects at this point, which can be a major
                            factor in whether you get clients or not.

                        </p>

                        <div class="twitter-card">
                            <h4 class="twitter-card-title"> "Our data archives, collected over time, might unwittingly
                                encapsulate the very biases we seek to overcome. These biases find their way into the
                                algorithms, resulting in skewed outputs."</h4>


                        </div>



                        <h3 id="sed-do-eiusmod-tempor-incididunt">Week 2: Connects
                        </h3>

                        <p>The concept of Connects acts as a token that is required by freelancers to get the clients to
                            send the proposal. To some extent, this must be a way to prevent spamming of their inboxes,
                            as it would seriously limit the people who are applying, at least the ones with malicious
                            intent. But it can also be a major hurdle for a beginner freelancer, as it was for me. You
                            need to have some money to spare or gamble on sending the proposals before you land a
                            successful gig.

                        <p><img src="/assets/img/allegory/robot and humanw.webp" alt="Image" /></p>

                        <p>As I closed the book that had ignited this trail of thought, I realized that the shadows in
                            Plato's cave weren't just an ancient allegoryâ€”they were living on in our AI systems,
                            compelling us to unravel their mystery. The journey from the cave's darkness to the light of
                            understanding requires not just algorithms, but a concerted effort to restructure our
                            societies, casting aside the chains of bias and forging a new path forward.

                        <h3 id="sed-do-eiusmod-tempor-incididunt">Week 3: Rethinking Cover Letters

                        </h3>

                        <p>We are all familiar with cover letters in the traditional job application sense. Upwork has
                            the feature of sending a cover letter with every proposal. As a beginner, you are compelled
                            to stick to the format that we are all used to, which can be a bit of a challenge to
                            actually land the job.


                        </p>

                        <p><img src="/assets/img/allegory/robot and humanw.webp" alt="Image" /></p>

                        <p>After facing a lot of unread proposals and wasted connections, I realised that I needed to up
                            my cover letter game; hence, I started being more strategic about standing out among the
                            crowd. This led me on to getting to the point where I could talk to people and further make
                            the impression that I was capable of doing their work.


                        </p>
                        <p>You see, Upwork is a fairly popular platform and has hundreds, if not thousands, of
                            freelancers looking at the same job you are looking for, which means there's a lot of
                            competition for even the simplest of gigs. The client is used to being bombarded with these
                            same generic-looking cover letters and may not even go through your profile if it doesn't
                            make you stand out.
                        </p>
                        <p>So the trick really is to put yourself in the shoes of the client, understand their needs,
                            and put their thoughts into your words. It has to assure the client that you are really what
                            they need for this job and have read the full description, which gives them confidence that
                            you are really capable of doing this. The format of the cover letter that we are taught to
                            write can be a hurdle in our freelancing journey. We need to rethink the whole cover letter
                            idea to stand out among the competition.</p>

                        </h3>

                        <p>This was another phase for my upwork journey, as with the jobs that you get initially, you
                            are compelled to put your prices fairly low, which means you donâ€™t have a clue on setting
                            the right amount for a particular gig. The freelancer pro gives you this ability to see what
                            the bidding ranges are for a certain project, which gives you a general sense of where you
                            want to put your pricing.

                        <p>I wouldn't say this is a game changer or even worth it for everyone, but if you want to go
                            the extra mile to do justice to yourself fairly, along with understanding the competition,.
                            This can be a good-to-have tool.

                        </h3>

                        <p>Upwork in 2024 is a great way to have a bit of passive income if you have the skills and
                            patience to be tested by this platform. There are definitely challenges in navigating this
                            platform, but the reward can be quite fruitful once you understand this path. The only
                            advice I can give, as someone who's also a beginner and is figuring it out, is that you need
                            to get your hands dirty. The ultimate hack or trick, whatever you may want to call it, is to
                            just get started.
